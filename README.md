UCD Thesis - Markdown Template
==============================

NO WARRANTY that this works for current UCD requirements ;)

How to write your thesis
------------------------
 * Download all the files here (use the HTTPS clone URL listed on the righthand side of GitHub repo)
 * Using your favorite Editor
	* Edit `metadata.md` file with thesis details including title,
	abstract, program, and more (see the file and Metadata section below
	for more details)
	* Edit the `.md` files in `chapters` folder, add more if you need. Each
	filename should starting each with the numbered order in which they
	should appear. Note that the top-level section headers are chapter titles.
	See _Using paper sources as chapters_ below for more possibilties.
	* add bibtex entires to `example.bib` (or change the bibliography file in `metadata.md`)
 * Build
 	* type `make` in a shell prompt, this will produce a `mythesis.pdf` (edit the `Makefile` if you'd like a different filename)

 * There are many optional sections that you can add via `metadata.md` (more details below)
	* Dedication
	* Acknowledgments
	* Preface
	* Copyright page

## Metadata

In `metadata.md` is a YAML-formatted set of metadata for the thesis. Most field names are self-explanatory. The entries below 'abstract' deal with formatting. Some details on the others:

* `iselectronic:` 1 - yes, 0 - no
* `isdissertation:` 1 - PhD, 0 - MSc
* `degreemonth:` Choices are September, December, March, June

In addition to the above, there several optional fields. To use, these entries below  should be cut/pasted into the metadata block in `metadata.md` (i.e., the entries between --- and ... )

Copyright page is optional. If you have one, it
 must immediately follow the title page. For more information about the
 copyright page see the UCD's Office of Graduate Studies web site.

    copyrightpage: true

Dedication as a potentially multi-paragraph entry like the abstract

    dedication: |

        For my parents

        and for my brothers

Acknowledgments as a potentially multi-paragraph entry like the abstract

    acknowledgments: |
        A great many folks

        A second paragraph of folks

A preface can be included as a .tex file by giving the filename:

    preface: preface.tex

## Using paper sources as chapters

It's handy to just in-line a paper into the thesis. Several features help with this.

_Separate the body and title filenames_, as is done in the provided example files. To ensure correct order use `-` for title files and `_` for chapter body files, e.g. `1-title.md` and `1_a-great-chapter.md`. Note for `.md` sources you may have to increase the nesting of each heading. (You could use `sed 's/^#/##/g'` for this.)

_Inline latex files_, which you can do using the latex syntax `\include{file}` in a markdown file. An example is included in `3_chapter.md` and `3_latexchapter.tex`.
